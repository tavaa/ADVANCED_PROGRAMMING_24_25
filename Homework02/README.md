## Introduction

This project presents an advanced Scientific Toolbox for Statistical Analysis and Integration, meticulously designed to streamline complex tasks and deliver powerful, user-friendly solutions. By combining cutting-edge statistical methods with an intuitive CLI, this toolbox empowers researchers, analysts, and professionals to extract meaningful insights with ease and efficiency. Whether tackling intricate datasets or integrating diverse analytical processes, this tool redefines simplicity and precision in statistical analysis.

## Features 

- **Statistical Module**: Allow the user to run analysis on a custom dataset in .csv format. In this module, they are also implemented several tests and an application developed with this Toolbox refered to a student's Dataset.

- **Integration Module**: A very intuitive and user-friendly module to approximate definite integrals using custom functions, parsed on CLI, with varyous methods and personalized parameters.

## Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++).
- Make (optional, if you are using Makefile).
- Python3.

## Usage

*Installation*

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tavaa/ADVANCED_PROGRAMMING_24_25.git
   ```

3. **Prepare Dependencies**  
   Navigate to the `/include` directory:  
   ```bash
   cd ADVANCED_PROGRAMMING_24_25/Homework02/include
   ```

Download Boost 1.86.0 from boost.org and extract its content into this folder.
https://www.boost.org/

Download libmuparserx 4.0.12 from muparserx and extract its content into this folder.
https://beltoforion.de/en/muparserx/

3. **Return to the Main Directory**
    ```bash
    cd ..
    ```

4. **Install Python Dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. **Launch Main Script**
    ```bash
    python ScientificToolbox.py
    ```

*Usage*

Choose the module to use, through the CLI. It will be easy and intuitive to understand how to use.

**Custom Statistics Analysis**

1. Insert a dataframe in .csv folder into `/dataset` directory.
2. Modify the `Custom_analysis.cpp` script in order to perform your own Analysis.
3. Once you have complete, save the script and run again the python script.
4. The output of your analysis must be specified in your script (default in `/output/statistics/`).
5. You can use `/apps/Custom_analysis.cpp` as the template of your implementation.

**Custom Integration**

1. Run the main python script, then choose 2, then 1.
2. Parse your expression (no spaces).
3. Select other parameters (lower bound, upper bound, N, method).
4. The output will be saved into `/output/integration/`

*Debug*

Sometimes, Statistics module get bugged. No worry, just re-run the script, or navigate into the folders and run bash scripts.

You can use built-in tests to ensure the functionality of the framework.

## Student Analysis

Navigate into `assets/` folder to see an example of output of the framework. This example has been elaborated in order to explain the performed analysis and the evaluation of the results. In particular, we have presented:

* Summary Statistics
* Performance by Gender
* Impact of Parental Education
* Impact of Test Preparation
* Score Distribution by Race

## Implementation Choices

The data acquisition from the CSV file was handled using `std::optional<std::variant<int, double, std::string>>` to efficiently capture the contents of individual cells, accounting for potential missing or invalid values. This approach ensures flexibility and robustness when dealing with incomplete datasets. Once the data was extracted, it was processed using custom-built statistical modules designed for tasks such as data summarization, variance analysis, and correlation computation. Additionally, a dedicated module was implemented to approximate definite integrals. This module leverages numerical integration techniques and exposes its functionality through a **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**, enabling users to compute integrals of specified functions directly from the terminal. The integration module includes tailored functions for common scenarios, ensuring precision and usability in a wide range of applications.
